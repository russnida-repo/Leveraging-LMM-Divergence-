# Appendix F - Glossary

## 1. Logic & Argumentation Terms

**Argument:** A set of premises and a conclusion intended to establish
the truth of the conclusion.

**Premise:** A statement offered as support for a conclusion.

**Conclusion:** The claim an argument attempts to establish.

**Validity:** A property of arguments where, if the premises are true,
the conclusion must be true.

**Soundness:** An argument that is valid and has all true premises.

**Assumption:** An unstated premise necessary for an argument to
function.

**Hidden Assumption:** A required but unspoken premise that influences
validity or soundness.

**Burden of Proof:** The obligation to justify a claim with adequate
evidence.

**Fallacy:** An error in reasoning that undermines an argument’s
validity or soundness.

**Modus Ponens:** A valid logical form: If P → Q; P; therefore Q.

**Modus Tollens:** A valid logical form: If P → Q; ¬Q; therefore ¬P.

**Straw Man:** Misrepresenting an argument to make it easier to attack.

**Steelman:** Strengthening an argument by presenting its best possible
version.

**Stress Test:** A procedure that examines how an argument holds up
under alternative scenarios or edge cases.

## 2. LMM Evaluation & Methodology Terms

**Large Multimodal Model (LMM):** A model capable of processing and
generating multiple data types such as text, images, or structured
inputs.

**Hallucination:** A confident but incorrect output produced without
factual grounding.

**Divergence:** A difference in reasoning, verdict, or protocol behavior
between models.

**Protocol:** A structured, step-by-step evaluation method applied to
model outputs.

**8-Step Protocol:** A short-form argument evaluation method used in
this study.

**14-Step Protocol:** A deep-form evaluation method that reveals hidden
assumptions and logical weaknesses.

**Temperature:** A model parameter controlling randomness in outputs.

**Run Type:** The type of evaluation performed (8-step, 14-step,
combined, etc.).

**Model Behavior Signature:** A consistent pattern in how a model
reasons or responds across multiple arguments.

**Bias Mitigation:** Techniques to reduce unwanted or unintended model
biases.

## 3. Domain-Specific Terms (Evolution, ID, Climate Science)

**Evolution:** The process by which populations of organisms change over
generations through natural selection and genetic variation.

**Common Descent:** The evolutionary principle that all organisms share
a common ancestor.

**Irreducible Complexity:** A concept from Intelligent Design claiming
certain systems cannot evolve through incremental changes.

**Intelligent Design (ID):** The view that certain features of life are
best explained by an intelligent cause rather than natural processes.

**Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW):** Warming of Earth’s climate
caused primarily by human activities.

**Climate Sensitivity:** The expected temperature increase resulting
from doubling atmospheric CO₂ concentrations.

**Attribution Study:** Climate science method for determining the causes
of observed climate changes.

**Comparative Healthcare System:** The analysis of health systems across
nations to evaluate efficiency and outcomes.

**Systemic Fraud:** Widespread, coordinated election fraud capable of
altering outcomes—not just isolated incidents.

## 4. Methodological & Analytical Terms

**Consilience:** Convergence of evidence from multiple independent
sources.

**Causal Chain:** A sequence of connected events or conditions where one
leads to another.

**Interpretive Depth:** The level of sophistication in a model’s
reasoning or explanation.

**Protocol Sensitivity:** How much a model’s verdict changes when
switching between evaluation methods.

**Inference Strength:** How strongly evidence supports a conclusion.

**Empirical Support:** Support derived from observation, measurement, or
experiment.

**Metaphysical Claim:** A claim about the fundamental nature of reality
beyond empirical testing.

**Normative Claim:** A value-based claim about what should be done or
what is morally right.
