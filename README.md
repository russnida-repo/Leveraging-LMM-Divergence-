# 📘 Leveraging LMM Bias: A Systematic Multi-Model Divergence Study

A structured evaluation of how large multimodal models (LMMs) interpret, analyze, and reason over identical arguments—and how their divergent reasoning patterns reveal exploitable bias.

This repository contains the full report, appendices, figures, and downloadable formats for the study.
